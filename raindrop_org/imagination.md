please find a statement of Alfred Einstein regarding importance of visualization

------

Albert Einstein emphasized the importance of visualization in understanding complex concepts. He is famously quoted as saying, "Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating progress, giving birth to evolution." This reflects his belief that visualization and imaginative thinking are crucial for grasping and advancing knowledge in science and other fields【139†source】.

Einstein also mentioned the value of looking deeply into nature to gain a better understanding of everything, reinforcing the idea that visualization helps to connect with the deeper aspects of reality【140†source】. These ideas underscore the significance he placed on visual thinking as a powerful tool for learning and discovery.

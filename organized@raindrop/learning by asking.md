*I think that learning by asking concrete questions makes learning more effective. tell me something about it*

You're absolutely right that learning through asking concrete questions can be highly effective. This method leverages several cognitive and psychological principles that enhance understanding, retention, and application of knowledge. Here's why this approach works so well:

### 1. **Active Learning**
   - **Engagement**: Asking concrete questions requires you to actively engage with the material. This active participation helps to anchor new information in your memory, making it more likely to be retained.
   - **Focus**: Concrete questions focus your attention on specific aspects of a topic, leading to a deeper understanding of that particular area rather than a superficial overview.

### 2. **Critical Thinking**
   - **Analysis**: When you ask a concrete question, you're required to analyze what you already know and identify gaps in your understanding. This process encourages critical thinking and helps in developing problem-solving skills.
   - **Application**: Concrete questions often stem from real-world scenarios or practical needs, helping you apply theoretical knowledge to actual situations, which reinforces learning.

### 3. **Personalization of Learning**
   - **Relevance**: By asking questions that are relevant to your needs or interests, you make the learning experience more personal. This personalization increases motivation and makes the learning process more enjoyable.
   - **Self-directed Learning**: This approach puts you in control of your learning journey, allowing you to explore topics at your own pace and according to your curiosity.

### 4. **Immediate Feedback**
   - **Clarification**: When you ask a concrete question and receive an answer, it immediately clarifies any misconceptions or uncertainties you might have had. This immediate feedback loop is crucial for reinforcing correct information.
   - **Adaptability**: If the answer to your question isn't fully understood, you can immediately ask follow-up questions, making the learning process dynamic and adaptable to your needs.

### 5. **Deeper Understanding**
   - **Exploration of Details**: Concrete questions often lead you to explore details that might otherwise be overlooked in broader study. This exploration leads to a more comprehensive understanding of the topic.
   - **Connections**: Through concrete questions, you often end up drawing connections between different pieces of knowledge, integrating new information with what you already know.

### 6. **Memory Retention**
   - **Contextual Learning**: When you learn something in response to a specific question, the context in which you learned it can help trigger your memory later. This is known as context-dependent memory.
   - **Chunking**: Asking concrete questions can help break down complex information into smaller, manageable pieces ("chunks"), which are easier for the brain to process and remember.

### Summary
Learning by asking concrete questions transforms the passive absorption of information into an active and engaging process. It enhances understanding, fosters critical thinking, and makes the knowledge more relevant and applicable to real-world situations. This method not only improves retention but also empowers you to become a more self-directed and effective learner.
